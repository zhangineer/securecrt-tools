Single Device Scripts
=====================

Single Device Scripts are scripts that are designed to be lauched in a SecureCRT tab that is already connected to a remote device.  These scripts will make necessary terminal changes, perform their task, and return the terminal back to the original state so that the user can continue working after the script executes.

These scripts can also be imported into Multi-Device scripts to reduce the amount of copying and pasting of code that is required to make a multi-device version.
